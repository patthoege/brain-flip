* I research on various memory card games to gain insights. During this process, I drew inspiration from the <a href=""> Pawshake</a> website and incorporated some of its key service points into my own.

# Acknowledgments
This website was created as part of my Full Stack Software Developer Diploma at the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and serves as my Portfolio Project 1. I am grateful to acknowledge my mentor [Martina Terlević](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinaterlevic/), the Slack community, and the entire team at the Code Institute for their assistance and support throughout this process. Pawsome Care has been an invaluable learning experience for me, enabling me to gain greater confidence in my abilities to design, build, test and deploy a fully functional website.
